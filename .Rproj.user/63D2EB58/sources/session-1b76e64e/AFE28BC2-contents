# Expectation

HD students Expectation of grades, do HD students expect significantly different results than non high performing students. Proportions of expectations ought to remain consistent through

# How do average time spent of HD students on studying compare to non HD students.

Comparing the mean study times of students who scored a HD grade against students who did not score a HD grade.

# How does employment affect study habits of HD students

Take a subset of data where all students scored HD historically and filter for realistic submissions. How does the employment status (casual, part time, full time) of students influence hours studied.
